# Local Eats  
  
  **Local Eats** is a web application that allows users to post their favorite selfmade dishes along with information about where the dish can be bought, the time when the dish is available, and the price. 
The application is built using HTML, CSS (tailwind), javascript, Node.js, Express.js, SQL, Sequelize, Bcrypt for password security, and uses the Geolocation API of the browser.
