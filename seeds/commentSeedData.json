    "notes": "I am absolutely blown away by this home-made pozole! I've been craving a good bowl of pozole for weeks and decided to give this app a try. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. The pozole was perfectly seasoned, and the broth was rich and flavorful. I loved the generous portions of tender pork and the hearty hominy, which were the perfect complement to the savory broth. Plus, the toppings like radish, avocado, and lime really took it to the next level. I will definitely be a repeat customer and can't wait to try more dishes from this app!",
